Python
Linting - Ruff can be used to analyze the code, promote clean and consistent code, early issue detection, better readability and maintainability, can be customized to specific needs, instant error highlighting, enforce strict coding standard for seamless teamwork, catch common error, reduce manual code review efforts, better performance, scalability and security
Testing - unittest framework can be used to test the code, inspired by JUnit, similar to vitest this is use to check the functionality of the code as required and step by step. there are also other alternative depending on the python framek work i.e. Django using Django test runner
Building - Back4app Containers, open-source platform that enables to deploy and scale apps using globally distributed containers. back4app container integrates well with github, scaling with zero down time deployments, easy to use.
CI Alternatives: CircleCI - can be used as on cloud, server or self-hosted, similar to Github actions it would depend on the need of the application.
I.e. code or data being processed is sensitive, self hosted runner would be more secure than cloud based assuming all security requirements are met in the self-hosted server
. Cloud option has less management as CircleCI will handle the system, developers can have instant access to new feature and upgrades, pay what you use
